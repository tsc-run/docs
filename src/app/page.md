title: What is tsc.run?
---

The Serverless TypeScript framework. {% .lead %}

`tsc` usually compiles your code. Ours compiles your entire backend.

**tsc.run** (TypeScript Cloud) helps you build, organise, and deploy serverless apps with conventions and a standard
project layout. Define
a function, export it, and let the framework handle the rest, from routing to deployment.

## Why tsc.run?

tsc.run is built to make modern TypeScript serverless apps *just work*. Here's what makes it different:

- 🧾 **Typed Request/Response** for building REST APIs with confidence.
- 🔍 **Automatic function discovery** - REST routes, jobs and subscribers: just export and deploy.
- ⚡️ **Dispatch or emit** - beautifully expressive ways to run background jobs or emit events.
- 🔧 **High-level resources** - define databases, caches, and queues in a single config.
- ☁️ **Built for AWS** - with GCP and Cloudflare support coming soon.
- 🚀 **No Docker. No zips. No infrastructure.** Just `tsc-run deploy`.
